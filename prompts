Problem 

What is the problem you are trying to solve?

We are solving the problem of unstructured performance feedback from Workday feedback PDFs by using GenAI to transform them into clear, KPI-aligned summaries for employees and managers.
What is the problem statement theme you feel your problem aligns to and why do you feel it aligns to that theme? 

Employee Engagement and Experience.
Explain why this is a problem, who is impacted and why it is worth solving? 

Manual review of unstructured performance feedback is inefficient, inconsistent, and limits the ability to align individual contributions to organizational goals
Explain the problem in more detail:
Who is impacted:
Managers: Must manually read and interpret feedback for all direct reports
Employees: Receive vague or inconsistent growth feedback
HR & Leadership: Lack visibility into performance trends across teams
Why should we spent time solving this:
Enables consistent, KPI-aligned feedback
Reduces review preparation time for managers
Enhances employee development and engagement
Converts static PDFs into an actionable knowledge base
How will your solution address the problem statement:
The GenAI Performance Feedback Analyzer transforms unstructured Workday PDFs into structured, KPI-aligned summaries using Amazon Bedrock. This end-to-end solution integrates with AWS DHP services—S3, Bedrock, and knowledgebase—and delivers a secure, role-based interface to help employees reflect and grow, while enabling managers to make consistent, data-driven assessments.

Describe the solution in detail, including key features and functionalities.
DHP (Bedrock) and GenAI Studio will be available for use
We propose a GenAI-powered Performance Feedback Analyzer that automates the transformation of Workday-generated PDF feedback files into structured summaries aligned with our organization’s KPIs and values. The solution uses Amazon Bedrock and AWS DHP services to extract and summarize data, stores it in a knowledge base, and delivers insights through a secure, interactive web app hosted on EC2 or ECS. This tool empowers employees and managers to engage in more effective, data-driven performance conversations.
We will build a GenAI-powered analyzer that:
Reads feedback PDF files from Workday and stores it in Amazon S3
Uses Amazon Bedrock (LLM models) to summarize achievements, strengths, and improvement areas
Provides a secure, role-based web app for employees and managers to access personalized insights.

Extract Feedback -> Store Securely -> Summarise with GenAI -> Display Insights
