## Introduction

The purpose of this article is to document how we should manage work as a company. 
This ranges from Jira ticketing conventions, to how to prioritise tickets, to running retrospectives on sprints,

The diagram below illustrates the general path that our work takes from conception to completion.
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
