### 21 September 2017 (My farewell note for Mahesh).txt  ----------------------
Hey Magician!
  
Your contribution was truly valuable for the team. I don't think there is even one person in 
BI&A who has not worked with you or used your magic in his/her project! 
You were always fostering our models with good quality data and without you, it will be hard to provide food for them!
I wish the best for you in your future career. You will be missed a lot.
Regards
