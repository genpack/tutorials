### 10 Jul 2017 (How I published a shiny dashboard for the first time).txt  ----------------------
Create ui and server objects: ui = dash.ui
Create an app object appobj = shinyApp(ui, server)
run the application: runApp(appobj, host = "0.0.0.0", port = '8080')

Then find your ip address: everybody should be able to see it: 
example:   http://10.47.167.132:8080/
