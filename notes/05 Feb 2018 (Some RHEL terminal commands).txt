### 05 Feb 2018 (Some RHEL terminal commands).txt  ----------------------

# To change read/write permission:
#   sudo chmod 755 -R /srv/shiny-server/<foldername>
#   
#   To change the mode of a file, use the chmod command. The general form is
# 
# chmod X@Y file1 file2 ...
# where: X is any combination of the letters `u' (for owner), `g' (for group), `o' (for others), `a' (for all; that is, for `ugo'); @ is either `+' to add permissions, `-' to remove permissions, or `=' to assign permissions absolutely; and Y is any combination of `r', `w', `x'. Following are some examples:

# chmod u=rx file        (Give the owner rx permissions, not w)
# chmod go-rwx file      (Deny rwx permission for group, others)
# chmod g+w file         (Give write permission to the group)
# chmod a+x file1 file2  (Give execute permission to everybody)
# chmod g+rx,o+x file    (OK to combine like this with a comma)

Some file systems are limited to a certain total space
