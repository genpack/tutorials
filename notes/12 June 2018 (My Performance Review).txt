### 12 June 2018 (My Performance Review).txt  ----------------------
I believe I have exceptionally demonstrated CBA values:
  
  Integrity: I always work with honesty and integrity. This has been acknowledged by the people who know me or have worked with me.

Excellence: I focus on using the best and latest technology to provide customized technical solutions to my customers. Innovation and out-of-the-box thinking, is a key attribute of my methodologies. I have the confidence to claim that my models are customised for specific business requirements and cannot be outperformed by other data scientists in terms of performance and accuracy!
  
  Smart Optimiser is a great example for this: 
  I reformulated the problem and changed solution space because the problem as formulated based on the definition of requirements could be extremely computationally expensive and not solvable by even fastest processors. The BMO team acknowledged that their initial methodologies failed to find the solution in a reasonable time.
The model is customized for CBA business requirements which makes it kind of unique in the world. 

Collaboration: Working closely with delivery team as well as end-user customers helped them understand the model and become familiar with it. This was achieved via lots of meetings (formal and informal) and training sessions. Just for Smart Optimiser, I spent more than 200 hours working with multiple model users down to the lowest level of details trying to help them go through various scenarios. These sessions also helped me to understand issues in the developed model as well as business requirements. I tried to hide complexities and designed the model to be as user‐friendly as possible so that it can be tuned, used in a proper and efficient way and implemented easily by a non‐technical user. 

Accountability: Supported by many examples, some of which outlined in my KPI reviews, I have demonstrated consistent accountability in all my projects as I believe everybody must be accountable for whatever he/she does. I dedicate to the projects and continuously work with the end customer or delivery team to address new requirement and rectify issues.

Judgement: I was trusted to be the leading data scientist in both my projects: ATM Optimisation and Smart Optimiser, which makes clear that my judgment capability was demonstrated. Fast and decisive decision making in ambiguous conditions is a key requirement in a data science project. Some examples are outlined in my KPI reviews.

Service: Smart Optimiser aims to improve the service we offer to our internal customers directly and external customers indirectly. I have seen through the project right up to when the business starts using the model on a regular basis. An example is the time I spent at Parramatta with the document custody team in GLS east aiming to fully understand their specific requirements and existing business constraints. This helped me to be able to customize the model to meet their requirements as much as possible. As a result of this service, I received a quarterly awards nomination from this team for whom we implemented the pilot run. 


RISK:
  
  Being accountable for risks associated with my models, I always spend adequate time to find out and list all possible incidents and issues which can be resulted from my models in all stages of design, delivery and production. For example, I am cautious of over‐trusting outputs of ML or optimisation models I train and build by testing and validating them multiple times before issuing the product to minimize unexpected and unreasonable outputs. 

I am aware of risks related to data security and do not share ant part of the data, information or insights with any party outside the team. 
As a career policy, I always complete my scheduled trainings before due date and follow standard operational procedures within CBA group.

KPIs:
  
  In this financial year, I have been leading the Smart Optimiser project which demonstrated results and benefits to the business. I was the only technical accountable person for the model. Most of evidences and examples I bring are therefore related to this project:
  
  Operating Model - following GDS operating model and ways of working:
  Being in the Group Function spoke within the hub & spoke operating model, we are expected to be the frontiers and have more interaction with the business.  This is what I emphasis in all my projects. As stated in the values section, I have held regular sessions with my stakeholders to ensure clear understanding of business requirements. I also share and exchange ideas with the hub and other spoke colleagues.  

Risk Culture:
  I have added my model, Smart Optimiser to the GDS risk register outlining all the risks associated with the project in delivery and production phase and appropriate controls. (You can find Smart Optimiser in the GDS risk register)

GDS Brand:
  
  Following core competency framework enabling clear skill enhancement
I enhanced my knowledge in the following areas:
  
  Recent vector-based NLP techniques for improved word metric determination.
Latest techniques of using elastic net and ridge regression techniques in improving the accuracy of ML models.
Improved visualisation techniques with D3 and Java-script based packages.  
New process mining algorithms.
Predictive process monitoring through ML and simulation.
BPMN standard, understanding semantics and data structure.


Delivery of projects within time and budget:
  
  Smart Optimiser model has been delivered successfully. The project has been productionized and is used by the business (FCO team and a few teams in GLS east and Bankwest). We are working on productionizing in enterprise level. In addition, I developed front-end UI to replace existing excel based UI giving business more control on using the model and improve task allocation in their teams. 
A web-based application integrated with a live running model is an essential requirement for delivery and productionizing of a data science project which extremely helps to deliver within budget.

Expand and deepen customer relationship:
  I shared details of technical solutions and methodologies behind Smart Optimiser with different staff in the BMO team. I had such technical sessions with Tim Pope, Eliot Dawson, Kelumi and Suraj himself.
I helped them build their custom settings and data input/output pipelines to use the model in their customized way. As a result, BankWest, FCO and GLS teams each use the model in their won customized way with different settings. 

Evidence of ensuring project focus on the financial wellbeing of people, businesses and communities:
  
  Smart Optimiser is currently used daily to allocate work to 100 FTE of 3 teams in GLS East, FCO team and one team in Bank-West. It is in progress to be deployed to 3 more teams in GLS East and 5 teams in Bank-West.
The last report generated by the Business Modelling and optimisation team in Group operations states that the FTE benefit realisation for FY 2018 is 13.3 FTE, which results in a cost savings of $590,000. This saving has been achieved via improving team throughput which means the productivity (count of jobs completed) in the same time and with the same amount of resources have improved by almost 13%. This has direct impact on our customer satisfaction.

For three of the teams in GLS east the values are:
  "	Document Custody team: Capacity creation of 1.3 FTE (45 hours per week) in a team of 26 FTE.
"	Aftercare NSW: Allocations done for 30 FTE with 2 FTE benefit realisation.
"	Credit Card: 2.5 FTE benefit realisation in a team of 30 FTE.

Discipline of 100% completion of PPMC when required:

Done timely mostly, Only a few examples of delay.

Improving productivity: focus on outputs that promotes self-service functionality and reusability:

The Smart Optimiser model and its UI are presented as a set of packages with API documentation provided for any developer. The documentation is clear, and the model is simple to use and exploit. This feature, enables the BMO team to run the model for different teams, each team by its own set of constraints and customized requirements with miNicolasl coding efforts required. 

Experimentation - identify efficient ways of working and capabilities to improve velocity and profitability:

Culture - Participation in group and analytical initiatives to improve people engagement and drive one team culture:

"	Aries:
  A couple of sessions with Aries in which we discussed and brainstormed methodologies for AML and gain valuable features by building a network of transaction data.
"	Mohammad Multiple sessions and meetings with Mohammad regarding the Branch cash optimisation project. I tried to understand business requirements and share my experiences in the ATM cash optimisation project.
"	Event Miner peer review

Development - proactive self drive of own learning and development.

"	Process mining
"	Linux systems and Docker containers/Shiny Server/ application hosting/ product administration/ database connection/
  "	Visualisation techniques/ packages 


"	One day training on PKW
"	Constantly reading

Diversity and Community- Contribute and support the Group's expanding diversity and inclusion agenda:

"	Regular Interviews: I am a member of the interview panel and have had multiple stages 1 & 2 interviews with new Potential candidates. Example: Brad was interviewed by me and Stephan and is now a data scientist of GDS team.

Safety:
  
  I believe I have achieved expectations with respect to my KPIs over the last financial year. My efforts to build a mathematical optimisation model to solve the problem of optimal task allocation is an example where I have performed to the expectations set in the cost and advanced analytics KPIs.
The novel approach developed for the SO project was key to the model being used on a daily basis as the model run time reduced to seconds from hours.
Such a huge cost has now been eliminated from the business.
My model was instrumental in making the pilot implementation successful. Using this model Group Operations achieved
significant improvement in team throughput improving resource utilisation and significant reduction in backlogs as
demonstrated in their metrics.
The model led to improved service outcomes, significant reduction in team leader's time potentially increasing coaching
and other activities.



I was also a trusted advisor to the Business Modelling and Optimisation (BMO) team in group operations. 



The feedback from these teams have been consistently glowing and
the Smart Optimiser project would not be successful without Nicolas. The CEO award highlights what an asset he is to the
Group and how much of a role model he is.
In addition, Nicolas has demonstrated his ability to lead people. This has included working closely with Mustafizur initially on
the project, and now in his leading of Ryan, the new intern. Nicolas was also a mentor to many others in the team including
other associate data scientists. Many a time, these data scientists would comment that Nicolas was the most technically skilled
person they had worked with and sought his guidance often.
Lastly, Nicolas's resilience and unfailing attitude means that he is able to see his projects through from start to
implementation. Where a lot of people would be inclined to get frustrated or give up, Nicolas shows that he can stick with
any problem and find new ways and approaches. Nicolas has also become much more engaged with the business, working
hand‐in‐glove with them to understand what is needed.
Well done Nicolas!
