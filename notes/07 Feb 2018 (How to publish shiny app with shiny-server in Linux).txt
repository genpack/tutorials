### 07 Feb 2018 (How to publish shiny app with shiny-server in Linux).txt  ----------------------
You need to first install shiny-server

After installation:
- To start or stop shiny server:
$ sudo systemctl stop shiny-server
$ sudo systemctl start shiny-server

The config file is usually here:
etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf

There is a text file containing important commands like which port should the app be published or the physical address of the apps:
This file is named shiny-server.conf and is usually in: /etc/shiny-server/
Contents of shiny-server.conf:
# Define the user we should use when spawning R Shiny processes
run_as shiny;

# Define a top-level server which will listen on a port
server {
# Instruct this server to listen on port 80. The app at dokku-alt need expose PORT 80, or 500 e etc. See the docs
listen 80;

# Define the location available at the base URL
location / {

# Run this location in 'site_dir' mode, which hosts the entire directory
# tree at '/srv/shiny-server'
site_dir /srv/shiny-server;

# Define where we should put the log files for this location
log_dir /var/log/shiny-server;

# Should we list the contents of a (non-Shiny-App) directory when the user 
# visits the corresponding URL?
directory_index on;

After copying each app in a folder in the shiny-server site directory: usually: srv/shiny-server/
start shiny-server and all the apps will be deployed:
<server_name or http://ip_address>:<port_number>/<app_dirname>
Example:
http://10.39.4.184:3838/simple_app_test/
or
