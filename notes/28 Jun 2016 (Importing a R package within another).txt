### 28 Jun 2016 (Importing a R package within another).txt  ----------------------
If your package is using a function from another package, you should import that function in the namespace
For example:
  By putting this line in the code:
  #' import timeDate
  #' import niragen
  
  Roxygen will add it to the namespace

Also in the 
DESCRIPTION file of your package:
  You should add a line like this:
  Import:
  timeDate, nirgaen, ...
