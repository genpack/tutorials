### 19 Nov 2015 (R Version Problem).txt  ----------------------
What did I learn today:

to change the version of R underneath R Studio:
goto Tools --> Global Options --> General --> R Version --> Chaneg
Select the folder to your new R versio
Example:  [64-bit] \\naunsw001\Berta\R\R-3.2.2

Note: Good to know that you can extract the latest versin of R any where in your computer without having administrator access.
