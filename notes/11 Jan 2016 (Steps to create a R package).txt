### 11 Jan 2016 (Steps to create a R package).txt  ----------------------
# Step 1: install and library devtools
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
# step 2: Make a blank directory with the name of your package (without version) and setwd() to that path
# step 3: make a blank package devtools::document() --> select 1-yes
devtools::document()
# step 4: copy your roxygen documented .R file(s) to folder R in the package and run devtools::document() again
devtools::document()
# step 5: from RStudio menu --> build --> build and reload
# I received a warning:
# WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed. Please download and install
# the appropriate version of Rtools before proceeding:

# http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/
# I downloaded and installed it. It was known by devtools but not by detected by R Studio
# To check if Rtools is detected by devtools:
devtools::find_rtools(T)
# Scanning path...
# Scanning registry...
# Found c:/Rtools for 3.3
# VERSION.txt
# Rtools version 3.3.0.1959
# [1] TRUE
#
# To check if Rtools is in the R Studio path list:
Sys.getenv()['PATH']

# step 6: Check all your functions are available in the package, if not make sure they are mentioned in the NAMESPACE file in the root of your package

# Use function devtools::build() to build a compressed package ready to be installed by install.packages()
devtools::build()
